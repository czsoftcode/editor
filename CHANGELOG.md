# Changelog

All notable changes to the PolyCredo Editor project will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Terminal CPR (Cursor Position Reporting)**: `PtyEvent::PtyWrite` events (responses to `ESC[6n` DSR queries) were being silently discarded. They are now written back to the PTY, allowing programs like vim/nvim and bash prompts to correctly detect cursor position.
- **Terminal Confirmation**: Added a confirmation dialog before closing a running terminal in the AI panel to prevent accidental process termination.
- **AI Viewport**: Option to undock the AI terminal into a separate system window (viewport) that can be moved to another monitor.
- **Markdown Synchronized Scrolling**: Implemented proportional synchronized scrolling between the editor and the preview. Both panes can also be scrolled independently, and the preview now correctly reaches the end of the document regardless of content length.
- **Terminal Ctrl+X**: On Linux, egui converts Ctrl+X to `Event::Cut` instead of `Event::Key`, which `TerminalView` was not processing. Added an explicit handler that maps `Event::Cut` to control character `0x18` — nano and other TUI applications now correctly receive Ctrl+X.
- **Terminal Keyboard Input Out of Bounds**: `TerminalView` ignored keyboard input if the mouse was not hovering over the terminal. Added a fallback handler in `terminal.rs` that processes keys (text, Ctrl+letter, special keys) even when the terminal is focused but the mouse is elsewhere.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **LSP Hover Documentation**: Hovering the mouse over code triggers a `textDocument/hover` request (600 ms debounce). Result is displayed in a floating popup that correctly renders markdown — code fences are shown monospaced in blue, prose text in gray. Popup dismisses on mouse movement.
- **Go-to-Definition (F12)**: Pressing F12 at the cursor position sends a `textDocument/definition` request. The editor opens the target file and jumps to the correct line. Handles Scalar, Array and LocationLink response formats.
- **Autocomplete (Ctrl+Space)**: Pressing Ctrl+Space sends a `textDocument/completion` request. Results are shown in a floating dropdown (max 25 items) with kind labels (`fn`, `st`, `kw`, …). Navigate with ↑↓ arrows, accept with Enter or Tab, dismiss with Escape, or click an item.
- **LSP Capabilities**: Added `hover`, `definition` and `completion` capabilities to `InitializeParams` so rust-analyzer knows the editor supports these features.

### Fixed
- **Diagnostic Gutter Dots**: Colored indicator dots were overlapping line numbers. Dots are now placed on the left side of the gutter (left + 6 px), numbers remain right-aligned and unobstructed.
- **Diagnostic Underlines (Squiggles)**: Added 2 px colored underlines beneath lines with LSP diagnostics — red for errors, orange for warnings, blue for information, green for hints.
- **Diagnostic Count in Status Bar**: The status bar now shows `✕ N` (red) and `⚠ N` (orange) counts for errors and warnings in the active file. Counts are only shown when greater than zero.
- **Hover Popup Markdown Rendering**: The hover popup now correctly parses fenced code blocks instead of displaying raw ` ```rust ``` ` markers.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **LSP Client MVP**: Integrated Language Server Protocol (LSP) support via `async-lsp`.
- **Rust Integration**: Automatic detection and startup of `rust-analyzer` for Rust projects.
- **Inline Diagnostics**: Real-time visualization of compilation errors and warnings directly in the editor gutter.
- **Diagnostic Tooltips**: Detailed error messages displayed on hover over the line numbers.
- **Asynchronous Architecture**: Implemented a robust, non-blocking LSP communication layer using Tokio.

### Fixed
-   **LSP Client Stability**: Corrected a critical panic on startup by properly entering the Tokio runtime context before spawning the language server process.
-   **LSP Initialization Loop**: Resolved an infinite retry loop in `render_workspace` that occurred when LSP client initialization failed, preventing system resource exhaustion.
-   **LSP Failure Handling**: Improved `init_workspace` to correctly mark `lsp_binary_missing` when LSP client initialization fails, ensuring the "Install" prompt is shown and retries are prevented.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Build Runner Profiles**: Introduced project-specific build/run configurations via `.polycredo/profiles.toml`. Supports environment variables, custom working directories, and automated Rust error parsing.
- **Collapsible UI**: Integrated runners into the build panel as a space-saving collapsible menu.

### Fixed
- **Terminal Text Selection**: Improved text selection and copying. Newlines are now preserved, trailing spaces are trimmed, and the implementation is now part of the editor to avoid modifying vendored code.
- **Debian Version Format**: Corrected `.deb` package versioning to `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD_NUMBER` (e.g., 0.4.2-48).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **TOML Configuration**: Switched from JSON to TOML for application settings (`settings.toml`) with automatic migration of existing configuration.
- **CI/CD Quality Gate**: Introduced automated code quality checks (formatting, clippy, tests) using GitHub Actions and a local `check.sh` script.
- **Shared File Index**: Implemented `ProjectIndex` for asynchronous and incremental project file indexing. Unifies data for Ctrl+P, global search, and file tree.
- **Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)**: Added a central command menu with i18n support for quick keyboard-driven editor control.
- **Quick File Open (Ctrl+P)**: Implemented fuzzy file search with automatic scrolling to the selected item.

### Fixed
- **Scrolling in Ctrl+P**: Fixed an issue where the selected item disappeared outside the visible list area during arrow navigation.
- **Search Performance**: Global search (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) now utilizes the shared index instead of repeated disk scanning.
